This project can run 3 different clients which can be handled by a server.
To run the project, first the server is to be run and then each of the clients.
Each client opens up as a GUI where one can select options like “send username to server”, 
“Generate random number and send server” and “log out".
Client is connected with Client using socket and it sends its username to the server using the username entered by the user.
A client can also generate a random number between 5 to 15 and send that to the server.
Then the server waits for those many random number of seconds.
In server side, the thread is made to sleep for that many seconds.
The clients and server send its messages in HTTP Post formats.
Additionally, it can also log out from the connection with the server and thus the server closes this socket.
After successful connection with each client, the server updates the username in its GUI.
